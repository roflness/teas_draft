		title: "Continuing the Process",
		description:
			"The State of California has set clear goals to increase the numbers of EVs in MD/HD fleets by the year 2030 and beyond. To support this transition, SDG&E is investing $107 million to build supporting infrastructure at over 300 private and commercial fleet sites by 2025. Municipalities are also providing EV-supportive funding, as well as accelerated project reviews. Additional programs are likely to emerge as needs become more defined over time. Your first EVSE project will likely be the most time-intensive, since you will be working on this with your utility, vehicle manufacturers, and EVSE vendors for the first time. You will likely find that subsequent projects - whether follow-on phases of your first project or projects at new facilities - become more efficient through established relationships. In either case, the following best practices will help you optimize results.",
